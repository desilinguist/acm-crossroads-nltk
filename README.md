# acm-crossroads-nltk
The repository for my ACM Crossroads article on NLTK, originally published in 2007.

The various `task*.py` scripts have the code from the original article. The `tex` file contains the LaTeX source for the article. However, the best option is to basically look at the iPython notebook file since that is the easiest way to read and play around with the code while you are reading.
